Vana Learning was an Education Technology startup by Vanderbilt students in 2017-2019. Vana Learning originally started as a platform for teachers to track habits of students with ADHD; parents were able to see the student's 'report cards' with these habit scores at their convinence. Vana Learning partnered with one school, but found that the data collection and analysis did not move the needle in student outcomes enough to continue development.

Vana Learning pivoted in 2018 to create a platform for academic coaches to track sessions, grades, and progress with students. One academic coach used Vana Learning throughout the 2018-2019 school year and provided bi-weekly feedback and feature requests. However, at the end of that year, the founders of Vana Learning had graduated and started other jobs, so the startup was discontinued.
